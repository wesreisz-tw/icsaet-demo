"do rev; Review and validate the implementation approach for [TASK_ID] based on research findings.

The task requirements are specified in task-[N].md and the initial implementation plan is in task-[N]-plan.md.
Based on your research of the existing codebase:

1. Validate that the existing plan in task-[N]-plan.md is feasible
2. Identify any adjustments needed based on current codebase state
3. Confirm all dependencies and integration points are addressed
4. Finalize the step-by-step implementation checklist
5. Ensure no creative decisions remain for the execution phase

If the existing plan needs significant changes, update task-[N]-plan.md accordingly.
The final plan must be exhaustive enough that execution requires no creative decisions."
